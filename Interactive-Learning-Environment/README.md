- **Visual block-based programming** with gradual transition to text-based coding
- **Interactive lessons** for hands-on learning
- **Teacher dashboards** for progress tracking and analytics
- **Gamification elements** to maintain student motivation
- **Adaptive learning** features that personalize experiences
- **Collaborative features** for peer learning

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth
- **Block Editor**: Custom visual programming interface
- **Deployment**: Docker-ready
